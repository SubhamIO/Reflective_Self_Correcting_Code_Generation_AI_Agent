# Build a Reflective Self-Correcting Code Generation AI Agent

In this project we will be building an intelligent self-correction code generation AI Agent which can generate working code for user problems, leverage the reflection pattern to examine and test the code and improve and correct it.

### Reflective Self-Correcting Code Generation AI Agent

This project focuses on building a **Reflective Self-Correcting Code Generation AI Agent**, designed to iteratively generate, execute, and refine code to achieve accurate solutions. The workflow integrates reflective reasoning and error analysis to ensure robust and functional code generation. The workflow includes the following components:

1. **Code Generation**:
   - The system utilizes **OpenAI GPT-4o** to generate code based on the user's input and problem requirements.
   - Code is generated following a predefined schema, including:
     - **Prefix**: Problem description or setup requirements.
     - **Imports**: Necessary libraries or dependencies.
     - **Code**: Functional implementation of the solution.

2. **Code Execution and Reflection**:
   - The generated code is executed, and the results are analyzed.
   - If an error occurs, feedback is provided to refine the code:
     - **Error Feedback**: Captures errors or unexpected behaviors during execution.
     - **Reflection**: GPT-4o reflects on the error feedback to iteratively improve the solution.

3. **Iterative Correction Loop**:
   - The system repeats the generate-execute-reflect cycle until:
     - A successful solution is achieved (no errors).
     - The attempt count exceeds a predefined threshold (`N`), ensuring the loop terminates if a solution cannot be reached.

4. **Attempt Counter**:
   - Tracks the number of attempts (`K`) and increments with each iteration.
   - If the attempt count exceeds the predefined threshold, the process halts, and the user is informed.

5. **Final Validation**:
   - Once the code passes execution without errors, the refined solution is presented to the user as the final output.

6. **User Feedback Loop**:
   - If the user is unsatisfied with the solution, the process can be restarted to refine the code further or adjust the requirements.
